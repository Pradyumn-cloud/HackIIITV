We made a chrome extention named- "Sevak"

🚀 Features

✅ Simplified Navigation: Helps users understand and follow complicated government processes.
📄 Document Checklist: Automatically shows what documents are required for a specific service.
💰 Fee Estimation: Tells you how much the service costs, including any hidden or optional fees.
🕒 Processing Time: Gives a realistic estimate of how many days it will take to complete.
📌 Important Updates: Alerts users of recent changes in rules, deadlines, or procedures.
🤖 AI-Powered Assistance: Uses Generative AI to answer your questions in simple language.
⭐ The best part is that Sevak understands exactly which website you're on, so its advice is specific to what you're trying to do.


🔧 How It Works
